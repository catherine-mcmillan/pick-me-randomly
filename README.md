# pick-me-randomly
Random selector based on Excel Workbook data -- Used for Nail Polish selection, but flexible for any random selection
Updated to include personal voting app and statistics to better understand preference data. 

# Problem 
I own over 850 bottles of nail polish. I'd like to say that they are unique, but I am pretty sure that some are so similar that they may be considered the same. 
The amount of choice and the problem of recency bias (AKA shiny new thing) prevented me from really enjoying my collection. I was spending a lot of time just trying to decide which nail polish to use. I would poll my partner and my friends. Choosing the "right" nail polish was becoming a hobby all on its own. But, it wasn't an enjoyable one. And, it also did nothing to curb my impulse shopping for shiny new things which exacerbated an already excessive problem. 

# Solution
1. Create an automation to limit my choice. I wanted a random selector that would *force* me to wear my collection. I could deviate from the selected polish, but it would be logged and the automation would prevent previous polishes from being selected again.

2. Expand on the solution. As I spent time with my random polish picker, I realized that I had unconscious behaviors when I wasn't excited about a polish as well as strong conscious feelings when presented with a polish I loved or loathed. I realized I could use this information to inform my destash (selling) and buying behavior. But, I knew I could do more! I knew I could develop metrics and data to help me better understand which brands, colors, and finishes I actually LOVED and LOATHED. I could also better assess polishes I was disappointed in and which were unmemorable and therefore not important to my collection. 
Perhaps, more importantly, I could also increase my data lake by voting on a random selection of polishes. This would increase my data from a random selection twice a week to 5 random polishes in a match up. Did I have a clear winner? Or was it more a question of I love/loathe all of these? Did I forget about a truly magnificent polish that this activity reminded me was awesome?

# Reflection
In the end, I've learned a lot about my collection and myself. It's been a great tool for helping me to limit my over consumption. It has helped me be more thoughtful and intentional about my buying. 

This activity also reminded me that there is always data. In fact, there are always many different metrics that you can collect and evaluate for correlation with quality and enjoyment. You can always make a data based decisions if you are willing to be creative and find the metric that answers your questions.
